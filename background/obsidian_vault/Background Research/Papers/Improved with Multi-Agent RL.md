# Improving Retrieval-Augmented Generation through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
## Reference
https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15228

## Summary

This paper introduces MMOA-RAG, a framework that treats each component of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system as a reinforcement learning agent. By harmonizing all agents' goals towards a unified reward, such as the F1 score of the final answer, MMOA-RAG addresses misalignments between individual modules and the overall objective, leading to improved performance across various QA datasets.
