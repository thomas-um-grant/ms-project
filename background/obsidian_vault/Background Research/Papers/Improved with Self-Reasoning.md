# Improving Retrieval Augmented Language Model with Self-Reasoning
## Reference
https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19813

## Summary

This paper proposes a novel self-reasoning framework aimed at improving the reliability and traceability of RALMs, whose core idea is to leverage reasoning trajectories generated by the LLM itself. The framework involves constructing self-reason trajectories with three processes: a relevance-aware process, an evidence-aware selective process, and a trajectory analysis process, which leads to huge improvements in RAG reasoning performance across a wide range of tasks within limited training resources.
