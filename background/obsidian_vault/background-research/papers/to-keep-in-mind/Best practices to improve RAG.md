## Summary

This study investigates key factors influencing the performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, including language model size, prompt design, document chunk size, and retrieval strategies. By developing advanced RAG designs that incorporate query expansion and novel retrieval strategies, the study provides actionable insights for developing adaptable and high-performing RAG frameworks in diverse real-world scenarios.

## Advantages

- **Contrastive In-Context Learning (ICL):**  
    Dramatically improves factuality and relevance by providing contrastive examples (correct vs. incorrect) as retrieval inputs.
    
- **Focus Mode Retrieval:**  
    Selects only the most relevant sentences, reducing noise and improving accuracy, especially for commonsense questions.
    
- **Robust Prompt Design:**  
    Helpful prompts significantly outperform adversarial ones; even small wording changes can yield performance gains.
    
- **Minimal Gains from Scaling KB Size or Doc Chunks:**  
    System performance is largely independent of knowledge base/document size once a baseline is met—suggesting efficiency can be preserved.
    
- **Empirical Framework for Best Practices:**  
    The study systematically benchmarks 9 RAG design dimensions using strong quantitative metrics (ROUGE, MAUVE, FActScore, etc.).

## Disadvantages

- **Multilingual Context Integration Underperforms:**  
    Mixing languages in the knowledge base slightly reduces coherence and factual accuracy, unless tightly controlled.
    
- **Retrieval Stride Trade-offs:**  
    More frequent retrievals (smaller strides) destabilize context and reduce performance, contrary to some prior work.
    
- **Query Expansion Has Marginal Impact:**  
    Only small improvements observed from adding expanded queries—limited utility in certain contexts.
    
- **Resource Constraints on Scaling:**  
    Most experiments use a 7B model for feasibility, limiting insights into performance at scale.
    
- **No Compositional Combinations Tested:**  
    The study isolates variables but doesn’t test effects of combining multiple enhancements (e.g., ICL + Focus Mode).

## Questions

- Can Focus Mode and Contrastive ICL be combined to achieve synergistic gains, or do they have conflicting effects?
    
- How would performance change across more diverse languages or low-resource multilingual settings?
    
- What’s the best way to automatically adapt retrieval stride dynamically during generation?
    
- Could agentic or autonomous RAG agents decide between retrieval strategies (e.g., stride vs. focus) on-the-fly?
    
- How can we design prompts that are _robust to adversarial manipulation_ in real-world deployments?
    
- Would fine-tuning the query expansion model for a specific domain yield better results than generic T5-based expansion?
    
- How might these retrieval strategies generalize to multimodal contexts (e.g., images + text)?
    
- What are the long-term effects of using contrastive examples, do they bias models or help generalize better?
    
- Could future architectures learn to rank retrieval methods based on query intent or domain classification?
