## Summary

This paper presents Relational Reasoning Paths, which is a way to represents relations in between concepts extracted from the original corpus. This enables PathRAG to outperform [[LightRAG]], enriching the semantic and comprehension of the model for higher quality response.
It still relies on vector database to retrieve indexed nodes.
