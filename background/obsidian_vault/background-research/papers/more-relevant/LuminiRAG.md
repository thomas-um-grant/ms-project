## Summary

LuminiRAG is a next-generation Retrieval-Augmented Generation system designed to process complex, multi-modal documents by integrating advanced vision-language models with dynamic knowledge graph construction. Building upon GraphRAG and LightRAG, LuminiRAG introduces key innovations: intelligent content relevance filtering, cross-modal semantic integration, multi-hop query decomposition, and adaptive graph-enhanced retrieval. It demonstrates significantly improved performance in complex document understanding tasks involving tables, images, cross-references, and long-form structured documents.

## Advantages

- **Vision-Language Fusion:**  
    Sophisticated OCR and visual analysis preserve relationships between text, tables, and images, enabling accurate context reconstruction.
    
- **Graph-Based Knowledge Representation:**  
    Combines dynamic entity extraction, hierarchical relationship mapping, and confidence scoring to build robust, queryable knowledge graphs.
    
- **Advanced Query Processing:**  
    Multi-hop reasoning, adaptive thresholding, and decomposition enable LuminiRAG to handle complex, multi-faceted questions.
    
- **Semantic + Graph Retrieval Integration:**  
    Leverages both vector similarity and structured graph traversal for more accurate and explainable answers.
    
- **High Accuracy on Complex Queries:**  
    Outperforms traditional vector and GraphRAG methods in accuracy (80–95% vs. 70–85%) especially in multi-page and multi-modal financial documents.
    
- **Flexible Architecture:**  
    Cloud-native (AKS), scalable system with dual storage (pgvector + NetworkX) balances semantic search with relational reasoning.

## Disadvantages

- **Processing Overhead:**  
    High accuracy comes with significant latency (2.5x vector baseline), limiting suitability for real-time applications.
    
- **System Complexity:**  
    Architecture involves sophisticated orchestration, graph construction, and dynamic validation, increasing engineering and resource costs.
    
- **Scalability Limits:**  
    Large-scale deployment across thousands of documents may strain memory and computational budgets without further optimization.
    
- **Multimodal Error Sensitivity:**  
    Integration across modalities (e.g., aligning OCR output with structured tables) remains sensitive to document quality and layout variability.

## Questions

Can graph-based and vector-based retrieval be more deeply integrated to reduce redundancy and processing time?

How can LuminiRAG be adapted to real-time environments without sacrificing multi-hop reasoning accuracy?

What new evaluation metrics could better capture the cross-modal reasoning capabilities of such systems?

How would combining LuminiRAG with agentic workflows (e.g., planner/critic agents) improve long-context document analysis?

Could transformer-based graph neural networks replace NetworkX for more scalable and learnable graph construction?

Is there an optimal balance between early content filtering (for efficiency) and late-stage cross-reference resolution (for accuracy)?

What techniques could enhance temporal reasoning or handle contradictory information across versions of the same document?

Could the system be made explainable enough to support high-stakes applications like regulatory auditing or legal discovery?
