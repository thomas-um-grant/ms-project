\section{History of VLMs}

\subsection{OCR Approach}
\begin{itemize}
\item Intro
\item Set the scene
\item Dive into to technique
\item Further information
\item Limitations
\end{itemize}

\subsection{PaliGemma}
https://huggingface.co/google/paligemma2-10b-mix-448 \\
SIGLip with Pali3

\subsection{ColPali}
Late interaction from ColBERT with PaliGemma

\subsection{Different approaches like VDocRAG and ViDoRAG}

\subsection{Evaluation}
Dataset creation (DocVQA, â€¦) \\
Condense all information retrieved from different benchmarks and dataset construction. \\
ViDoRe \\
OpenDocVQA / ViDoSeek

\section{RAG to Graph RAG}

\subsection{GraphRAG}
Microsoft approach, DRIFT method

\subsection{LightRAG}
Enhancement with Late Chunking

\subsection{LuminiRAG}
MultiModal

\subsection{PathRAG}
Relational path

\subsection{KG2RAG}
KG to expand context and organize in 2 steps

\section{Groundbreaking techniques}

Definitely need to dig into this much more...

\subsection{Late Chunking}

\subsection{HyDE}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Project Plan}

Try merging ColPali with PathRAG? \\
Use mixture of techniques with DRIFT, HyDE, Late chunking, Late interaction. \\
Still need to find where there is a gap to bring novelty. \\
Add a GANTT chart.
